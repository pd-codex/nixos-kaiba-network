# Software-only secure-boot rehearsal

`kaiba-provision-rehearsal` runs the complete seven-operation development
campaign against a deterministic software model. It is the smallest prototype
boundary: it exercises campaign order, terminal dispositions, and
evidence production without opening a device, invoking RPIBOOT, controlling
power, staging media, or carrying an OTP-capable artifact.

Run the happy path from a checkout:

```console
nix run github:PseudoDesign/kaiba-provisioning#kaiba-provision-rehearsal -- \
  --rehearsal-id local-happy-path
```

The command writes one deterministic JSON report. A successful report uses
`rehearsal_passed`, `software_only_no_otp`, and
`rehearsal_only_non_authoritative`. Its physical-action booleans remain false
and its OTP write count remains zero. It cannot emit `security_applied`, update
inventory, or authorize a production operation.

Failure and uncertain-result paths are deterministic and have distinct exit
codes:

```console
nix run github:PseudoDesign/kaiba-provisioning#kaiba-provision-rehearsal -- \
  --rehearsal-id local-failure --inject-at 4 --inject-outcome failed

nix run github:PseudoDesign/kaiba-provisioning#kaiba-provision-rehearsal -- \
  --rehearsal-id local-uncertain --inject-at 1 --inject-outcome uncertain
```

The package is built in a separate derivation rather than selected by a
runtime flag on the physical lane guard. Nix checks inspect both its declared
safety marker and linked Go package strings to reject a dependency on the
physical Pi adapter, lane guard, or RPIBOOT implementation.

This command proves only that the software campaign behaves as modeled. It is
not hardware evidence and must never be imported into a real asset lifecycle.

## Authenticated restart integration check

The separate
`TestAuthenticatedRestartReconcilesRealAdapterWithoutRedispatch` integration
test covers a narrower but deeper execution boundary than this runnable
rehearsal. It uses durable control and audit stores, mutually authenticated
HTTP reads, the restricted Unix authority bridge, plan compilation, the lane
guard's durable execute-once journal, and the production Raspberry Pi 5 adapter
implementation. The test simulates lost responses both after and before the
first ownership commit, reconstructs every service from disk after the
original mutation claim and approval have expired, and obtains a fresh
read-only reconciliation claim. ModeAuto then confirms either the owned
poststate or the exact fresh prestate without a second execute dispatch. The
fresh branch records a terminal confirmed-not-applied result and proves that
the current protocol refuses a replacement mutation claim.

The adapter's target-facing command runner, filesystem, GPIO, UART, and timing
interfaces are deterministic simulations. Consequently, the
`authenticated-restart-reconciliation` report row is software integration
evidence only: it is neither live-hardware evidence nor proof of production
security enforcement. Physical USB, power, RPIBOOT, UART, target-continuity,
and cold-boot behavior still require a rig test.

For the runnable end-to-end prototype that also exercises durable control,
audit, approval, intent, plan compilation, and restart binding before invoking
this same simulator, use
[the non-fusing secure-boot prototype](non-fusing-secure-boot-prototype.md).
